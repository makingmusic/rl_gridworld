# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation Guide

## Overview

This project now includes both **tabular Q-learning** and **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** implementations for the 2D gridworld environment. The DQN approach uses neural networks to approximate Q-values, making it scalable to much larger state spaces. The current implementation features **adaptive neural network sizing**, **multi-device support** (Apple Silicon MPS, CUDA, CPU), **obstacle navigation**, and **intelligent learning detection** with early stopping.

## Files Structure

## Key Differences

### Tabular Q-Learning vs Deep Q-Network

| Aspect | Tabular Q-Learning | Deep Q-Network (DQN) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Q-Value Storage** | Dictionary/Table | Neural Network |
| **Memory Usage** | O(states × actions) | O(network parameters) |
| **Scalability** | Limited to small state spaces | Scales to large/continuous spaces |
| **Learning** | Direct Q-value updates | Gradient-based optimization |
| **Convergence** | Guaranteed with proper conditions | Approximate, may be unstable |
| **Experience** | Uses current experience only | Experience replay buffer |
| **Training Speed** | Fast for small problems | Slower due to NN training |
| **Obstacle Support** | Basic (no obstacles) | Advanced (solvable mazes) |

## Neural Network Architecture

The DQN implementation uses a fully connected neural network with **adaptive sizing** based on grid dimensions:

```
Input Layer: 2 neurons (x, y coordinates, normalized to [0,1])
Hidden Layer 1: adaptive_size neurons (ReLU activation)
Hidden Layer 2: adaptive_size neurons (ReLU activation)  
Hidden Layer 3: adaptive_size neurons (ReLU activation)
Output Layer: 4 neurons (Q-values for each action)
```

### Adaptive Network Sizing

The network automatically adjusts its hidden layer size based on the grid dimensions using a sophisticated algorithm:

- **Small grids (≤100 states)**: 12 parameters per state
- **Medium grids (100-2500 states)**: 18 parameters per state  
- **Large grids (≥2500 states)**: 25 parameters per state

**Formula**: `hidden_size = sqrt(target_params_per_state * total_states / 2)` rounded to nearest power of 2

**Bounds**: Minimum 128, Maximum 2048 neurons

**Examples**:
- 7×7 grid (49 states) → 128 hidden neurons → ~33K parameters
- 50×50 grid (2,500 states) → 256 hidden neurons → ~131K parameters  
- 100×100 grid (10,000 states) → 512 hidden neurons → ~525K parameters

This ensures the network has sufficient capacity for larger grids while avoiding over-parameterization for smaller ones.

## Key Components of DQN

### 1. Neural Network (`DQN` class)
- **Input**: Normalized (x, y) coordinates [0, 1]
- **Output**: Q-values for all 4 actions
- **Architecture**: 3 hidden layers with ReLU activation

### 2. Experience Replay Buffer (`ExperienceReplay` class)
- **Purpose**: Stores past experiences to break correlation between consecutive samples
- **Size**: Adaptive based on grid size (5,000-200,000 experiences)
- **Sampling**: Random batch sampling for training

### 3. Target Network
- **Purpose**: Provides stable target Q-values during training
- **Update**: Copies main network weights every 100 training steps
- **Benefit**: Reduces oscillations and improves stability

### 4. Agent Interface (`DQNAgent` class)
Maintains the same interface as the tabular agent:
- `choose_action(state)` - Epsilon-greedy action selection
- `update_q_value(state, action, reward, next_state, done)` - Experience storage and training
- `getQTable()` - Approximates Q-table from neural network for visualization
- `getQTableAsPolicyArrows()` - Converts policy to arrow format

### 5. Multi-Device Support
Automatic device selection with fallback hierarchy:
- **Apple Silicon**: MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for M1/M2/M3 chips (tested)
- **NVIDIA GPU**: CUDA for GPU acceleration (untested)
- **Fallback**: CPU for all other systems
- **Benefits**: Significant speedup on Apple Silicon

### 6. Adaptive Buffer and Batch Sizing
Dynamic parameter adjustment based on grid size:
- **Buffer Size**: Scales with square root of grid area (5,000-200,000)
- **Batch Size**: Scales with grid area to power 0.25 (28-256)
- **Formula**: `adaptive_size = base_size * (total_states / reference)^scaling_factor`

### 7. Learning Detection and Early Stopping
Intelligent training termination:
- **Detection**: Monitors consecutive optimal episodes
- **Threshold**: Configurable (default: 5 consecutive optimal episodes)
- **Early Stopping**: Automatically terminates when learning is achieved
- **Benefits**: Saves computational resources and prevents overfitting

### 8. Obstacle Navigation
Advanced environment features:
- **Solvable Maze Generation**: Creates mazes with guaranteed paths
- **Obstacle Density**: Configurable obstacle percentage (default: 35%)
- **A* Pathfinding**: Computes optimal path length for learning detection
- **Wall Hit Tracking**: Monitors collision behavior for analysis

- `num_obstacles`: Number of obstacles generated
- `optimal_path_length`: A* computed optimal path length
- `success_rate`: Episode success rate
- `wall_hit_rate`: Average wall hits per episode
- `suboptimality_ratio`: Agent performance vs optimal path

## Tips for Best Results

### For Tabular Q-Learning:
1. Start with default parameters
2. Adjust epsilon decay based on grid size
3. Monitor Q-table convergence

### For Deep Q-Network:
1. **Adaptive Sizing**: Let the system automatically adjust network and buffer sizes
2. **Device Selection**: Ensure PyTorch detects your GPU (MPS for Apple Silicon tested)
3. **Learning Detection**: Monitor the learning progress display for early stopping
4. **Grid Size**: Start with smaller grids (7×7) to verify setup, then scale up
5. **Memory Management**: For large grids, monitor GPU memory usage
6. **Display Performance**: Adjust `LIVE_REFRESH_PER_SECOND` and `DISPLAY_STEP_INTERVAL` for large grids
7. **Obstacle Configuration**: Start with lower obstacle density (0.2-0.3) for easier learning
8. **Early Stopping**: The system will automatically stop when learning is achieved

## Troubleshooting

### Common DQN Issues:
1. **Q-values exploding**: Reduce learning rate or increase target update frequency
2. **No learning**: Increase exploration (higher epsilon, slower decay)
3. **Unstable performance**: Increase buffer size or batch size
4. **Memory issues**: Reduce buffer size or batch size
5. **GPU not detected**: Check PyTorch installation and device availability
6. **Slow training on large grids**: Enable GPU acceleration or reduce grid size
7. **Display lag**: Increase `DISPLAY_STEP_INTERVAL` or reduce `LIVE_REFRESH_PER_SECOND`
8. **Learning not detected**: Adjust `LEARNING_ACHIEVED_THRESHOLD` or check optimal path calculation
9. **Obstacle navigation issues**: Reduce obstacle density or check maze generation
10. **High wall hit rate**: Increase exploration or reduce obstacle density

### Performance Comparison (Current Implementation):
- DQN typically needs 2-5x more episodes than tabular for same performance
- DQN training is 3-10x slower per episode (mitigated by GPU acceleration)
- DQN memory usage is constant regardless of grid size
- Tabular memory grows quadratically with grid dimensions
- **GPU Acceleration**: 2-5x speedup on Apple Silicon MPS (tested)
- **Early Stopping**: Can reduce training time by 50-90% when learning is achieved
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Optimizes performance for different grid sizes automatically
- **Obstacle Navigation**: Adds complexity but enables more realistic environments

3. **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Sample important experiences more often
4. **Convolutional Networks**: For image-based states
5. **Larger Grids**: Test scalability beyond 200×200 grids
6. **Continuous Actions**: Extend to continuous action spaces
7. **Multi-Agent Environments**: Extend to multiple agents
8. **Dynamic Environments**: Add moving obstacles or changing goals
9. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with simple grids and gradually increase complexity
