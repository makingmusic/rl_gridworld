# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation Guide

## Overview

This project now includes both **tabular Q-learning** and **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** implementations for the 2D gridworld environment. The DQN approach uses neural networks to approximate Q-values, making it scalable to much larger state spaces. The current implementation features **adaptive neural network sizing**, **multi-device support** (Apple Silicon MPS, CUDA, CPU), and **intelligent learning detection** with early stopping.

## Key Differences

### Tabular Q-Learning vs Deep Q-Network

| Aspect | Tabular Q-Learning | Deep Q-Network (DQN) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Q-Value Storage** | Dictionary/Table | Neural Network |
| **Memory Usage** | O(states × actions) | O(network parameters) |
| **Scalability** | Limited to small state spaces | Scales to large/continuous spaces |
| **Learning** | Direct Q-value updates | Gradient-based optimization |
| **Convergence** | Guaranteed with proper conditions | Approximate, may be unstable |
| **Experience** | Uses current experience only | Experience replay buffer |
| **Training Speed** | Fast for small problems | Slower due to NN training |

## Neural Network Architecture

The DQN implementation uses a fully connected neural network with **adaptive sizing** based on grid dimensions:

```
Input Layer: 2 neurons (x, y coordinates, normalized to [0,1])
Hidden Layer 1: adaptive_size neurons (ReLU activation)
Hidden Layer 2: adaptive_size neurons (ReLU activation)  
Hidden Layer 3: adaptive_size neurons (ReLU activation)
Output Layer: 4 neurons (Q-values for each action)
```

### Adaptive Network Sizing

The network automatically adjusts its hidden layer size based on the grid dimensions:

- **Algorithm**: Targets ~15 parameters per state for optimal learning capacity
- **Formula**: `hidden_size = sqrt(7.5 * total_states)` rounded to nearest power of 2
- **Bounds**: Minimum 128, Maximum 1024 neurons
- **Example**: 100x100 grid → ~15,000 states → 512 hidden neurons → ~2.1M parameters

This ensures the network has sufficient capacity for larger grids while avoiding over-parameterization for smaller ones.

## Key Components of DQN

### 1. Neural Network (`DQN` class)
- **Input**: Normalized (x, y) coordinates [0, 1]
- **Output**: Q-values for all 4 actions
- **Architecture**: 3 hidden layers with ReLU activation

### 2. Experience Replay Buffer (`ExperienceReplay` class)
- **Purpose**: Stores past experiences to break correlation between consecutive samples
- **Size**: 10,000 experiences by default
- **Sampling**: Random batch sampling for training

### 3. Target Network
- **Purpose**: Provides stable target Q-values during training
- **Update**: Copies main network weights every 100 training steps
- **Benefit**: Reduces oscillations and improves stability

### 4. Agent Interface (`DQNAgent` class)
Maintains the same interface as the tabular agent:
- `choose_action(state)` - Epsilon-greedy action selection
- `update_q_value(state, action, reward, next_state, done)` - Experience storage and training
- `getQTable()` - Approximates Q-table from neural network for visualization
- `getQTableAsPolicyArrows()` - Converts policy to arrow format

### 5. Multi-Device Support
Automatic device selection with fallback hierarchy:
- **Apple Silicon**: MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for M1/M2/M3 chips
- **NVIDIA GPU**: CUDA for GPU acceleration
- **Fallback**: CPU for all other systems
- **Benefits**: Significant speedup on Apple Silicon and NVIDIA GPUs

### 6. Adaptive Buffer and Batch Sizing
Dynamic parameter adjustment based on grid size:
- **Buffer Size**: Scales with grid area (base 10,000, max 100,000)
- **Batch Size**: Scales with grid area (base 64, max 256)
- **Formula**: `adaptive_size = base_size * (total_states / 2500)^0.5`

### 7. Learning Detection and Early Stopping
Intelligent training termination:
- **Detection**: Monitors consecutive optimal episodes
- **Threshold**: Configurable (default: 5 consecutive optimal episodes)
- **Early Stopping**: Automatically terminates when learning is achieved
- **Benefits**: Saves computational resources and prevents overfitting

## Usage

### Running Tabular Q-Learning
```bash
python main.py
```

### Running Deep Q-Network
```bash
python main_nn.py
```

## Configuration Parameters

### DQN-Specific Parameters (Current Implementation)
```python
# Neural Network Parameters (Adaptive)
learning_rate = 0.001          # Lower than tabular (0.1)
buffer_size = adaptive         # Scales with grid size (10K-100K)
batch_size = adaptive          # Scales with grid size (64-256)
target_update_freq = 100       # Target network update frequency
hidden_size = adaptive         # Scales with grid size (128-1024)

# Training Parameters
num_episodes = 10000          # Increased for larger grids
epsilon_decay = 0.999         # Slower decay for better exploration
epsilon_min = 0.01            # Minimum exploration rate

# Grid Configuration (Current Defaults)
grid_size_x = 100             # Large grid for scalability testing
grid_size_y = 100             # Large grid for scalability testing
```

### Adaptive Parameter Scaling
The implementation automatically adjusts key parameters based on grid size:

| Grid Size | Hidden Size | Buffer Size | Batch Size | Est. Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 10x10     | 128         | 10,000      | 64         | ~33K            |
| 50x50     | 256         | 22,000      | 90         | ~131K           |
| 100x100   | 512         | 40,000      | 128        | ~525K           |

### Key Differences from Tabular Implementation
- **Learning Rate**: DQN uses 0.001 vs tabular 0.1 (neural networks need smaller steps)
- **Episodes**: DQN uses 10,000 vs tabular 500 (scales with problem complexity)
- **Epsilon Decay**: Slower decay (0.999 vs 0.99) for better exploration
- **Grid Size**: DQN defaults to 100x100 vs tabular 10x10 (demonstrates scalability)

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Tabular Q-Learning When:
- State space is small (< 10,000 states)
- You need exact Q-values
- Training time is critical
- You want guaranteed convergence
- Problem is well-defined and discrete

### Use Deep Q-Network When:
- State space is large (> 10,000 states)
- Memory is limited
- You need generalization to similar states
- State space is continuous or high-dimensional
- You're planning to extend to more complex environments
- You want to test scalability (current implementation handles 100x100 grids)
- You have access to GPU acceleration (Apple Silicon or NVIDIA)

## Visualization

Both implementations use the same visualization system with enhanced features for DQN:

### Rich Terminal Interface
- **Real-time Progress Bars**: Episode progress, position tracking, steps history
- **Learning Detection Display**: Shows consecutive optimal episodes and learning achievement
- **Neural Network Training Notifications**: Displays when NN training occurs
- **Adaptive Grid Display**: Automatically hides for large grids (>1000 states) for performance

### Visualization Components
- **Grid Display**: Shows current policy as arrows (small grids only)
- **Path Display**: Shows optimal path from start to goal
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time training progress with time estimates
- **Plots**: Steps per episode and epsilon decay (when matplotlib enabled)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Display Refresh Control**: Configurable refresh rate (default: 1 Hz)

- **Grid Display Toggle**: Automatically disabled for grids > 1000 states

The DQN agent approximates a Q-table for visualization by querying the neural network for all grid positions.

## Weights & Biases Integration

Both implementations support wandb logging with:
- Training metrics (steps, rewards, epsilon)
- Q-table heatmaps
- Episode statistics
- Neural network specific metrics (buffer size, training steps)

DQN adds additional metrics:
- `replay_buffer_size`: Current experience buffer size
- `training_step`: Number of neural network training steps
- `device`: GPU/CPU usage (MPS/CUDA/CPU)
- `total_states`: Grid size for scalability analysis
- `estimated_nn_parameters`: Neural network parameter count
- `parameters_per_state`: Parameter density ratio
- `adaptive_sizing`: Whether adaptive sizing is enabled

## Tips for Best Results

### For Tabular Q-Learning:
1. Start with default parameters
2. Adjust epsilon decay based on grid size
3. Monitor Q-table convergence

### For Deep Q-Network:
1. **Adaptive Sizing**: Let the system automatically adjust network and buffer sizes
2. **Device Selection**: Ensure PyTorch detects your GPU (MPS for Apple Silicon, CUDA for NVIDIA)
3. **Learning Detection**: Monitor the learning progress display for early stopping
4. **Grid Size**: Start with smaller grids (10x10) to verify setup, then scale up
5. **Memory Management**: For large grids, monitor GPU memory usage
6. **Display Performance**: Adjust `LIVE_REFRESH_PER_SECOND` and `DISPLAY_STEP_INTERVAL` for large grids

## Troubleshooting

### Common DQN Issues:
1. **Q-values exploding**: Reduce learning rate or increase target update frequency
2. **No learning**: Increase exploration (higher epsilon, slower decay)
3. **Unstable performance**: Increase buffer size or batch size
4. **Memory issues**: Reduce buffer size or batch size
5. **GPU not detected**: Check PyTorch installation and device availability
6. **Slow training on large grids**: Enable GPU acceleration or reduce grid size
7. **Display lag**: Increase `DISPLAY_STEP_INTERVAL` or reduce `LIVE_REFRESH_PER_SECOND`
8. **Learning not detected**: Adjust `LEARNING_ACHIEVED_THRESHOLD` or check optimal path calculation

### Performance Comparison (Current Implementation):
- DQN typically needs 2-5x more episodes than tabular for same performance
- DQN training is 3-10x slower per episode (mitigated by GPU acceleration)
- DQN memory usage is constant regardless of grid size
- Tabular memory grows quadratically with grid dimensions
- **GPU Acceleration**: 2-5x speedup on Apple Silicon MPS, 3-10x on NVIDIA CUDA
- **Early Stopping**: Can reduce training time by 50-90% when learning is achieved
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Optimizes performance for different grid sizes automatically

## Extension Ideas

The DQN implementation is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **Double DQN**: Reduce overestimation bias
2. **Dueling DQN**: Separate value and advantage estimation
3. **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Sample important experiences more often
4. **Convolutional Networks**: For image-based states
5. **Larger Grids**: Test scalability beyond 100x100 grids
6. **Continuous Actions**: Extend to continuous action spaces
7. **Multi-Agent Environments**: Extend to multiple agents
8. **Dynamic Environments**: Add moving obstacles or changing goals
9. **Curriculum Learning**: Start with simple grids and gradually increase complexity
